      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <div class="lyrics">
        You hide under bedsheets when you're tired <br>
        Call your hair a mess, but girl, you're fire <br>
        Your voice could silence a choir <br>
        You say you don't shine, girl, you're a liar <br>
        <br>
        You hide under bedsheets when you're tired <br>
        Call your hair a mess, but girl, you're fire <br>
        Your voice could silence a choir <br>
        You say you don't shine, girl, you're a liar <br>
        <br>
        And if you saw yourself through my eyes <br>
        You'd see the stars get jealous at night
        <br>
        Cause you glow, even when you say you don't <br>
        Like the moon pretending it's all alone <br>
        You shine, in ways you'll never know <br>
        Maybe it's grace, maybe it's light <br>
        Or maybe it's my love for you <br>
        You're meant to glow
