    <h2>Chapter X:</h2>
    <p>
      Until today, every time I’ve had to choose between you and me, I’ve always chosen you.
 Always tried to do what’s best for you. Always tried to be selfless - wherever I could.
 But what I’m about to say… I don’t know if it’ll be best for you. I just know I can’t keep hurting myself like this. So I’m sorry, in advance, for being selfish - probably for the first time in our story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been over a year since we started talking. Been 8 months since we became best friends. A month later, I realized I loved you. And a month after that, I knew I didn’t want to love you just as a best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to confess since what feels like an eternity. The first time I stopped myself from saying anything was when our boards were around the corner. Knowing that it's not the best decision to put that sort of a burden on you right before one of the most important exams of our life, I decided not to say anything. I didn't suppress my feelings though. I tried to make a song expressing what I feel for you. I made one. I poured everything into it. And then I waited, holding on to it like it was a secret too heavy to carry, hoping for the perfect moment. I waited a long time. And I tried my best to not say what I know I'm not supposed to say. But doing so often felt like strangling myself. You would even see it sometimes. Realise I'm holding something back in me. Ask me what it is. But I'd shrug it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point I did come very close to confessing. I nearly said it. In fact I did. After almost choking myself visibly in camera, I said "I like you". You being you took in a platonic sense. You said: “of course I like you as well”. I said more as just friends. You said - “Of course! I know. We're bestest of friends. I love you.” Now listen to me very carefully. I love you very much as well. But this was the first time your obliviousness made me ever scream at you so hard. You really think I was on the verge of a breakdown just to say I’m your best friend? And then when I said are we considering the possibility of romantic feelings being involved? You said that's a conversation to have in person. And soon it hit you - Wait were you just confessing just now??? So, out of respect for you, I backed off. Denied it. Lied. And you took everything that happened here as a joke.
    </p>
    Then, well, we did meet. At MUN. I wanted to bring up my song there so many times. But you were fixated over Gauri, being jealous over her for no reason and dismissing all my tries to bring it up. And so the two days passed and I never got to do what I wanted to. But then thankfully I was able to somehow come over to your place. And long story short I did show you the song. You heard it. You loved it. And you hugged me. And that's it? The song was literally called "Fallen for you". I even clarified that it's about you (which for some reason I had to despite the song having so many direct references to you). But still after like a week of that, my song was never brought up. That song was my way in. My start. My confession. And it felt like it vanished into thin air.
    <p>
    </p>
    Cut to a few weeks before your birthday. Here I was, still looking for the perfect opportunity to confess to you. I still believed doing so would be best when I meet you in person. I wasn't sure about that one though since if things go south, the day that's supposed to be all about you and supposed to be your best day of the year, well it could be ruined. And I didn't want that. But right around that time, your friend Faizaan messaged you. And when I teased you about it, you explicitly made it clear that you believe that you aren't ready for a relationship. You weren't even talking about me directly there. But I took it like you were. I cried that night thinking this is how it's supposed to go down. You won't be rejecting me because there's something wrong with me. But you'll do so because you think you're not ready. And the fact that there's nothing in this world that I can do about it, well that hurt me a lot. But I let it slide. I respected what you want and decided I'll not think about this till I think you might consider yourself ready for a relationship. And later on a video call you said the same thing to Vrinda when she teased you about me. That you're not ready. Confirming my suspicions.
    <p>
    </p>
    And now everything's going fine. I'm willing to wait for you. I don't care for how long I have to. But let me give you a clearer idea of the picture that's being played in my eyes.
    <p>
    </p>
    You love me. I love you. We both know that we are the best person for each other. You want exclusiveness from me. Getting jealous with the thought of me spending time with other girls. Crashing out when I joke about making out with someone.
    <p>
    </p>
    Yet hiding behind the mask of being best friends. Saying that you wanna cuddle with me. Saying that I'm your safe space. Tell me first thing whenever anything good or bad happens to you. How can you do all that to me, and yet whenever confronted you say that we're just friends?
    <p>
    </p>
    It's getting harder for me day by day pretending I'm ok with everything. But the truth is I'm not. You'll say that you don't want me to get a girlfriend because that would mean you and me not spending as much time together. However, me saying a simple thing, ie, "As long as I have you, why'd I get a girlfriend?" freaks you out. Surprises you like crazy. Do you still not realise that I only see you with me? When I say you're mine, I mean it. I want you to be mine. And just mine. Just like I wanna be yours. Only yours. But you don't seem to get it. I want you to get jealous over my female friends. Makes me feel appreciated. I want you to be mad at me every time I make a joke about being close with anyone else except you. But I don't want you to do so while you hide behind the mask of my best friend. Because you may obsess about girls being around me - you, Diti, are the only girl that I have in my mind 24/7. I don't want anyone else. I love you. And you do know that means something. I don't say it for the sake of saying it. I mean it. And if you're the girl that I'm in love with, why would I ever imagine being with someone else.
    <p>
    </p>
    I’m not asking you to change anything between us. I already have everything I could ever want in you. The only thing I don’t have is clarity. I can’t keep floating in the middle forever, unsure of what we are. So this is me, finally saying it - without jokes, without code, and without pretending. I love you. And I want to be with you, not just as your best friend, not just as your safe space, but as your boyfriend. So Diti… will you be my girlfriend?
