    <h2>Chapter X: Every Time I Almost Told You</h2>
    <p>
      There were so many moments where I nearly said it. When we held hands while running from dogs. When you hugged me
      after the song. When you smiled at me from across the room. Every time I saw you, I felt like blurting it out â€”
      but I was scared. Of messing up, of losing what we have. But not anymore.
      <br><br>
      I love you.
