    <h2>Chapter X: So close but yet so far:</h2>
    <p>
      I love you. That's been said loud and clear. But from time to time I’ve also tried my best to convey that I don't say that as just friends. I literally made a song called “Fallen for you” that’s written about you. Take the hint, women. So here’s my thought process of everything that’s happened in the last 4 months in my brain.

      I think I realised that I see you more than just as a friend around Jan end or Feb start. But you see I didn’t want you to be just a rebound crush that I picked up just to get over Arnima. I also didn’t wanna ruin my friendship with you. Couldn't afford losing the person who’s everything to me. I also didn’t wanna ruin either of our mentals before our board exams. And so for both of our best interests I decided to eat my feelings. For as long as I could. That was 4 days…. Told Vaibhavi and Gaurika about it on the fifth. So yeah fyi, they know that I like you. Should clear some stuff. I mean you can’t even blame me for doing so. I am supposed to tell this stuff to my best friend but well... you see the problem with falling in love with your best friend? But yes even though I told them I ensured that this wouldn’t reach you. Not till the right time. So well I channeled all my feelings in the song I wrote for you. And well ig writing’s easy when you're in love cause i finished 80% of the song within 2 afternoons. And then begin the process of keeping that song with me but not sending it to you even though I want to so badly.
