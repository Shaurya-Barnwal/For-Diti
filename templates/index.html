    <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>I started making this when u were sick. We weren’t talking a lot as you were resting and after a really long time
      I went to sleep without wishing you good night. I had only sent a message asking you to take care of yourself,
      unread. Sure, you’d gone “MIA” before — as Aayushmaan and I call it, but I always used to wish you good night
      anyway. However this time around aunty messaged on your behalf informing me that you’re sick. And so I realised
      she could read my texts and think I’m overly needy and desperate. Despite the fact that I am, I don’t want her to
      have that impression of me. Anyhow I was just lying on my bed thinking about the perfect gift for your birthday,
      which I haven’t been able to decide what could be. And so I eventually started thinking about all the memories I
      have with you. I can be so melodramatic sometimes. But anyhow, it hit me — what if I gave you these memories back?
      What if you had a way to go to these memories whenever you wanted to? So I got out of my bed. Told my mum I
      just had a terrific idea and needed to start writing stuff down. And just as I started typing this… guess what
      popped up?
    </p>
    <div>
      <img id="daddy" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='I will daddy.png') }}" alt="I will daddy">
    </div>
    <p>
      There goes my premise...
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="memory" id="Chapter1">
    <h2>The Daddy Incident</h2>
    <p class="1">Ahh yes. What better way to start this than to bring up the iconic “daddy” moment. Truth be told. I
      don’t have the complete details lodged in my mind anymore. You have always been big on nicknames. I personally
      wasn’t a natural nickname user myself. Hadn’t seen people use them so often and so casually. And to see you call
      people honey and sweetheart so often made me quite amazed. Soon as we were talking you called me sweetheart, a
      natural occurrence at this point of our relationship but back then stuff like that used to catch me off guard. And
      so I made a joke saying - “I swear one of these days my mother is gonna see these texts and get the very wrong
      idea”. Made you laugh so hard with that one. God do I love it when you laugh. Makes me feel a weird sense of
      accomplishment when I bring happiness to your face. But yes you doubled down eventually saying "Maybe I’ll use
      double the nicknames to actually get you in trouble." Never thought that would actually become true. In fact,
      we’re way past double. But yes to your doubling down I replied - “Whatever floats your boat…. Sweetheart!” One of
      the most iconic things I’ve ever said to you. Absolutely love it. Made you so flustered with that one. But yes
      that definitely sparked the chain of nicknames between us.
    <p class="1">Eventually I think you got comfortable with nicknames a bit too much. That's the thing that has been
      there between us since forever. You’ve always been ahead of me. At everything. We follow the same path and
      eventually I do catch up to you. But unfortunately or fortunately you always beat me with the check points. You
      called me daddy. Yep. I get that not knowing the “messed up” meaning might make it seem harmless,
      however as a person who knows well and good what that word stands for, it creeped the hell out of me. Idk about
      other people but as a virtuous person (relative term), I couldn’t stand having those kinds of conversations with a
      girl. Not the person I am and nor wanted to be. And I hadn’t really understood that you’re just truly innocent and
      didn’t mean to use the word with any bad intention. And due to that lack of understanding there I did a real pro
      gamer move. I blocked you. (Yeah... sighs while writing.) Made you so worried and panicked. I feel so terrible
      remembering
      that. God what you must have gone through the following night. All worried thinking if our slightly developing
      friendship went down the drain just like that. I mean cut to today where I’m literally ready to kill someone if it
      means I’ll get to talk to you and I don’t even have a topic to talk about. But anyhow as it turns out, our story
      was meant to go a lot ahead. Truly way ahead than I had imagined. So yes we met in school and I talked to
      Aayushmaan and then eventually to you. And after a million apologies I forgave you (don’t think I was mad really
      just being silly). I truly don’t get why I gave you such a hard time starting mein. You know there were so many
      times I had thought I should maintain my distance with this girl. But well. You are too irresistible. And
      honestly? I couldn’t be happier for that.</p>
    </p>

  <section class="memory" id="Chapter2">
    <h2>You Coming Over</h2>
    <p class="2">Till this date I have no idea how it happened but it did. And credit where it's due — special mention
      to Vaibhavi, and a lil bit to Arnima too, I suppose. It truly was undoubtedly the most unexpected thing
      u had ever done for me up to that point. You know recalling that moment also made me realise that I myself haven’t
      really invited you here. Not really. Because if we truly think about it, Arnima was the one who initiated the idea
      as a joke and Vaibhavi was the one who persuaded you behind the scenes. So I’d like to change that and invite you
      over here. That too pretty soon I may add.
    </p>
    <p class="2">It was all honestly done in quite some fashion as well. How you reached here and Krish & me made you
      wait at the gate alone because our hair and skin was too important at the moment (horrible we are), and how I
      could barely spend any time with you despite me being the one who invited you here officially. Trust me, despite
      how much you think I was fixated over Arnima that day, I truly was in awe of the fact that Diti actually is here.
      Couldn’t be with you a lot and when we were free it got too late and we could be together a lot. But yeah, you
      being there meant a lot to me.
    </p>
    <p class="2">Maybe I didn’t truly appreciate the moment back nearly enough back then. But looking back I’m just glad
      for it to have happened. I don’t know exactly how good friends we were at that point but you coming to a place for
      a friend to watch a simple performance, definitely up there on the list of things you’ve done for me I wouldn’t
      think a friend would ever be close enough to me to do. Truly grateful I again am.</p>

    <h2>Happy for you, Not for me </h2>
    <p class="3">So we fought. And we fought pretty bad actually. It happened because we were both being stupid and
      silly. In comparison I was probably worse but I’ve profoundly apologized for it multiple times and you’ve said you
      won’t talk to me anymore if I said sorry for that again. So for that I won’t say sorry here (I really am though).
    </p>
    <p class="3">It all started over something silly and I jokingly said no matter how mad you get, in the end you’ll
      just get desperate and come back to me saying SHAURYAAAAAAA. I mean looking back…. I see no lie here XD. But that
      probably isn’t the best thing a person who’s mad would like to hear. And so you started ignoring me. Leaving me on
      read and not replying. Now that's fair honestly you’re allowed to be mad but well you see; I’m immature. And so
      when you weren’t replying I again did my pro gamer move. Quite the person I am. But well that was only for like a
      very brief moment and I was annoyed at you not replying and wanted to annoy you back a little. But well when I did
      unblock you, you were even more mad and angry. Even I would be. And well it was a long conversation from there.
      And then a real silly thought hit me - is this friendship even worth continuing? I have no idea what came over me
      honestly. But you see I think what was going on in my mind was this is probably the closest friend I’ve ever had.
      You were the only person I had ever gotten so close to. Ever. Be it talking normally, sharing thoughts, feelings
      whatever. I’ve seen you be there for me whenever I’ve needed you and I wouldn’t say I had done the same a lot back
      but I was definitely willing to and was there whenever the opportunity presented itself (not having lunch together
      in school doesn’t count you know that's separate). But anyhow I said - “I think we should talk a little less” Now
      you know it, I know it. I’m basically ending things. I thought this was too much for me mentally. I can’t be
      connected to a person so much on an emotional level and then have so big fights with them for practically no
      reason at all. Didn’t seem good for my mental. And I can’t say this enough — I love you, I love you, and I love
      you sooo much for whatever you did ahead and not actually giving me what I had asked for. I can’t express this
      enough. I’m actually tearing up writing this. That night was sure one hell of a night. But not as bad as the next
      one.
    </p>
    <p class="3">When I said what I said, you simply asked a simple question - is that my solution to the problem? Idk
      why but it did make me reconsider everything. And fortunately I did take everything back. I was still mad at you
      for the rest of the night but by the morning I was fine. However you weren’t completely sure if I’m back to normal
      or not. I’ve told you this now and I'm pretty sure I got this from my father but I cool down as quickly as I heat
      up. Not entirely sure if it's good or bad but that's there. But you wanted to keep talking to me — about anything.
      Anything you could to make sure that I actually don't start “talking less”. Eventually we started talking
      about my performance. I started talking about how we could do things the next time. Maybe you and I could even
      perform together and you would come here again. However you said you might not be able to do that but you’ll be
      here to support me over a video call for sure. Me being confused asked why’s that? And that’s when you revealed
      your big plans of going abroad. Honestly it was quite the shocker. Like that genuinely hit me like a bus. I had
      never imagined and thought of you going away like that. I mean it's not like we would have stayed next door
      forever. We'd still go to college and very likely in different states at some point. But going abroad makes you
      practically inaccessible to me. Sure u can the argument of talking over video calls etc and meeting over the
      holidays, it simply isn’t the same. And that’s probably the first time it actually occurred to me how much you
      mean to me and how much I want you. You had cried a lot the night before and it was my turn now. I genuinely
      weeped like a baby after a pretty long time. And after two hours of crying, I typed the following message.
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='happy.jpg') }}" alt="happy">

    </div>
    <p class="3">Not completely accepting things but letting you know my feelings in my own way which I’m happy you
      understood. And so when you woke up on the third day I had both of us in tiers. But that was probably the first
      time deep down I ever felt that I loved you. Didn’t accept it just yet. But deep down, I knew.

    <h2>Farewell</h2>
    <p class="4">
      13th of January 2025. Boy what a day that was. It's definitely on the top 3 days I’ve experienced in my life so
      far. It began with me jokingly telling you the day before how I won’t be spending time with you and will probably
      stick with Krish and the gang. Now I know this is gonna be hard to accept but I say this with truth that I always
      planned and wanted to spend the day with you. In 11th I wasn’t even close with you. Yet on farewell I for some
      reason I felt like spending some time with you. You seemed like a nice person. And Krish as well obviously but he spent the time with you for the most
      part of the day and I wasn’t close to you enough to come in between as you guys edited the farewell video. But
      yeah — one regret I had from last year was not spending the farewell with more friends. But I planned to
      change that and hopefully spend some time with at least two people who’ve really made my year worth remembering -
      you and Krish. Well we don’t need to talk about what happened with Krish. But I’m glad my real best friend was
      with me as much as you could be.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      When I reached school, and you can verify this, you were the first person I called. You see, I knew the teachers
      weren’t gonna let us go in the same bus together. They’ll make us go classwise. And so I wanted to spend at least
      some time with you before we left. Unfortunately you were late that day. I just roamed around for 15 mins. Didn’t
      even wanna call Krish. And when I did, dumbass didn’t even pick up and I found him with Raunak. And then of course
      even in the bus he was with Shreya and Aditi and Raunak and I couldn’t even sit with my rest of the friends. You
      know the story, we don't need to make this too sad. You know at some point when I saw you down with Radhika and
      Gaurika, a part of me wanted to be like Ali and be a rebel and go sit with you in your bus. Like I probably
      wouldn’t even care what people would say. But then I saw sir send Ali back to his bus — and yeah, that was pretty
      disappointing. When we reached there we couldn’t be together because they made girls sit on the other side. And
      well there was the award ceremony, your speech and then eventually we did come back school.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      When we reached back we were given around an hour to get our photos clicked. And my Princess is getting pictures
      clicked with all of her friends. And then she soon comes to me and asks for our picture. And I go: JuST yOu aND
      mE? You looked like you’d punch me. But thankfully because of people surrounding us I supposed you didn’t. And
      despite what I said there is nothing more I wanted that day than a picture of you and me. You actually looked so
      pretty that day. And yes, Vrinda clicked our picture — and boy, she ain’t the GOAT for no reason.
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='photo1.jpg') }}" alt="Memory 1">
    </div>
    <p class="4">
      Probably my most favourite picture of us together. Absolutely love everything about it. Our on camera chemistry is
      pretty good I'm not gonna lie. But yes after that I didn’t have lunch with you. Not because I didn’t wanna have it
      with you but because I thought I should spend some time with my other friends as well. That’s the reason I tell
      myself to help myself sleep better while in reality I was just shy of your friends and didn’t wanna be tagging
      along with you too much cause I thought I might end up over doing it.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      And now. The highlight of the evening. The princess danced on stage!!!
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='dance.jpg') }}" alt="dance">
    </div>
    <p class="4">
      You told me you were gonna do it, but I didn’t expect you to do it that beautifully. Honestly? That probably made
      me fall in love with you right there — ngl. Truly justified your Ryan Princess award in classic Princess
      fashion. Truly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      We went to Mcdonalds after the farewell ended. Everyone was emotional and sad but I pulled you out in between
      while you were talking to someone because I had already called the taxi. And yeah then we went there and had a
      good time with Vrinda and Samarth. Loved that guy. And then eventually it was time to go home. That’s when
      something weird started to happen. I couldn’t explain if I tried but I was feeling something towards you. Like
      everyone I too wasn’t happy with the thought of school ending. But the thing is it's not the school that any of us
      were gonna miss. It was the people there. Without them, it was just a big building with red walls. Without the
      people it would just feel blue. But the thing is when we leave school we take one or two people from there with
      us, people who we plan to keep a part of our lives. That is probably what helps us go forward. You can’t bring
      everything from your past into your future. But having some meaningful fragments helps you move forward. You see,
      I didn’t have those fragments. I had a Jewel. And that jewel was you. And that jewel was soon about to go away. As my father was reaching closer to us,
      to pick us up and eventually drop us home, I could feel my heart sink. I wished this moment of me and you sitting
      together never ended. But the realisation that you’ll soon be going far far away from me, it almost killed a part
      of me. When we were about to get inside the car I told you: I’ll miss you. I seriously can not stress enough how
      many emotions in that moment through those words were being conveyed. I couldn’t cry in front of my father and so
      I pulled it together for a while, before eventually spending an undisclosed amount of time in the bathroom crying
      silently. That day was quite the roller coaster ride for me.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      Even though now we both plan to go abroad, there’s no 100% guarantee of how close our fates will let us be. But I
      believe in will more than I believe in fate. And that belief is what tells me that you and me princess, we got a
      long road ahead of us.

    <p>Well finally I'd just like to wish you all the happiness in the world. I’m not sure if you’re reading this on
      your birthday or a day before. (I might’ve gotten too desperate)
      I cried multiple times while writing this and I'm afriad that I might have made this a bit heavier than I should have. But

  <h2>Diti Diaries</h2>
  <p>Well I am a very weird creature of habit. I still have difficulty sleeping without wishing you good night. You'll probably call it unhealthy at this point. I wouldn't even disagree with you actually. But       you know what? I'm not much to care🤭

      <p>I almost burnt down my house today... I turned on the A/C of my room while sitting in the hall🙃 Who cares about wasting electricity (I might be a bit spoilt). I mean my aim was to keep the room cold so         when mum and dad are back they'll find the room already chill and so that would be nice probably. Now as I am sitting on the sofa I smell something weird. I thought it's coming from some place else since         I was sitting near the window. But the smell kept growing. I went to Samarth's room first to check if everything's fine. At this point I had my suspicions about the smell coming from a switch board. I            smelt the switch board of samarth's room but that wasn't the source. And eventually I checked the room whose A/C was on. And I could literally see huge sparks coming from the A/C socket board. It was             wild. The sunmica near the board had started burning. I mean it wasn't sunmica but more of a plastic like substance cause actual sunmica would have caught fire. But yeah I ran to the MCB board and asked           Samarth to tell me when the sparks stop. And one by one I turned off each MCB till they did. Even he was so scared. And then I called these guys. And they're not picking up the phone. Like what even is           the point of having one if you're not gonna pick it up in situations like these. But yeah eventually I called the electrician, he checked and said the wire we had used to extend the socket board wasn't           that good ig cause that is what caught fire. It wasn't as bad thankfully and everything was under control and safe. Definitely a close call though.</p>

      <p>I just got to know my Nani's gonna be coming here again. And unfortunately it's not gonna be for happy reasons. You remember me telling you that I'm taking them to the doctor a while back? Well it was for her knees. She'd randomly fall or slip while walking. I mean she had an injury 6 years ago where she fell into a hole or something cause she couldn't see properly. But recently this has been happening. So that didn't get better yet and doctors at Ranchi said she'll have to get an operation. They decided if that's the case then might as well get it done in Delhi. So yeah we'll be admitting her in Apollo most probably. We have good faith there and things have been good everytime we've had to go there for something. So fingers crossed everything should be ok again this time. But here's the interesting part: I'll have to stay with her in the hospital alone as the attendent. Papa won't be able to stay there the whole time since it's hard for him to take too long leaves from office. And mum would stay but with our house going through reparing and all right now and Samarth having his exams, it's not possible for her to spend the whole day there either. So yeah this is something new I'll be taking on. Hopefully I get to learn a thing or two from this.</p>
      <p>Good nini princess (I can still call you that right? I mean with you being mad and all idek how you're feeling about me these days. I just hope you've forgiven me by the time you're reading this)❤️</p>

      <h3><time datetime="2025-09-14">14th September 2025</time></h3>
      <p>Had a fun day today. Went to Pragyanshu's place for practice. We ended up choosing two songs for the moment. I still hope you could come and perform with me. He was asking about you too. I don't know Diti but the opportunity of being on stage and singing with you is too exciting and beautiful for me to just let go. Like imagine me and you up there, holding the mics and singing, you glowing as usual and looking your prettiest as I try and keep up. It's really too exciting. Like I can't help but start kicking my feet imagining that. That's literally all I pray for these days. God I just wish it comes true. Please. I also finished the first prototype web page I've been working on these days. That's how I got the idea to write here too. It's actually pretty interesting too. I'll explain.</p>
      <p>There's a thing called API. I don't know how much you know bout this but it's basically a useable database or resource that companies let you use to make your own personal projects. Spotify has one too. It basically let's you access the data about all the songs that the spotify's live library has. So you'll get access to info like the song's artist, popularity, its tempo, its energy, how groovy it is or dancibility in simpler terms. Now not all of the data is usefull for the general public but for music enthusiasts like you and me, or anyone who's deeply involved with music, these stats can help you in a lot of ways. But this data doesn't come up normally on spotify either. You could look things up one by one manually on google but that's very tedious and quite frankly boring. You could also use chatGPT. But by default chatGPT doesn't have the capibility to access spotify's API directly and so it can't give you the most useful insights and data. So my idea was what if I integrate chatGPT's API (basically it's inteligence in a form that I can reshape and reprograme to work according to my needs) in a way that it can access spotify's API directly to give me the the trends and analysis I have been looking for. Now this sounds really cool on paper. But actually making this is pretty tough. So for now I made something simpler. I call it MAST - Musical Anaysis of Statistics and Trends (Feel free to comment on the name btw).I used a csv file (a file that has a limited data about a limited number of songs, around 200k) and use python codes to use that data to produce graphs that help me understand it more fluently. Also say if I like a song. I can look up the song on my web page and it'll show me all the songs that are similar to it in terms of energy, dancibility or tempo. It can also give me comparison of that data of how when u increase the energy of the songs, the dancibility increases and etc. I can also look up an artist, say taylor swift up on the site. It provides me all of her songs and then presents me a bar graph showing how many of her songs are pop, country, rap, dance, or other genres and help me understand her kind of music better. It also gives me te average tempo of her songs in each category, gives me how high or low her songs are in energy and a few other bits of information. Now say if I were making a song that had an energy level of 0.6 or a scale of 0 to 1, i could set the levels to that and I could also set the tempo of the song. And then the web page presents me with all songs that follow my set criteria and so I can listen to those songs for further ideas and inspiration. Its a lot cooler when you try it yourself like I can't wait to show you. Now the version with the limited database works pretty well as of now. Now I'll start working on the spotify version and take it to the next step. If everything goes right this could be pretty big.</p>

      <p>Ok so we went to the hospital with her and apparently Nani's ACL tissue along with another ligament has broken. They can fix it with the operation it's not biggie. Now I came back with her in the morning and they said they'll admit her in the evening. Mum and Nani went back there in the evening and they're admitted there right now. I'll be going tomorrow morning and take mum's place and stay there for the day. Gonna be interesting for sure. I'll also be preparing Samarth's lunch tomorrow. So that should also be interesting. Let's see how everything goes. Wish me luck.</p>
      <p>Good nini and miss you as always❤️</p>

      <h3><time datetime="2025-09-16">16th September 2025</time></h3>
      <p>Boy what a day. I got up only after getting 3 hours of sleep today. Made pasta for my breakfast and Samarth's lunch. And then left for the hospital so I could switch with mum. I took the taxi but I was constantly sleepy. Like throughout. And the only thing keeping me up was all the serial killing shows I've watched where the person ends up getting kidnapped in a taxi. I had no intensions of becoming a victim. And there was so much jam on the road too. Literal hell. Anyhoo I got there and sent mum back home. Was with my nani for like 2 hours before she got shifted to the OT. And then it was all me in the bedroom area. And I have to say I had more fun than I thought. I tried to sleep but the attendent bed wasn't all that comfortable. So I put on Dexter's season 1 that I had downloaded before I left home. Its a goated series about serial killing you should check it out sometime. And then idk if you've ever been to the Apollo in Delhi but there's like all sorts of stuff on the ground floor, be it Haldiram or Barista. So I'd like watch the show for about an hour, go down because I'd have to pee and the only washroom I knew of was on the ground floor and I was too shy to ask where's the other. Then I'd eat legit whatever I want. So much variety too. So yeah I experimented a lot. Eat, drink, watch, pee and repeat. That's gotta be peak life. I tried Americano for the first time ever. That too iced. I legit thought of your coffee making mishap that you told me about. And let me tell you if you already didn't know this, though I'm sure you do, if you ever have to choose between drinking an americano or your own piss (like Bear freaking Grills or something), choose the later. Probably will taste better. Eventually after 4 hours I got a call from the doctor. The surgury was a success and they'll be keeping her for observation for a while. After a dozen calls to all the family members I was back to my routine soon. Eventually she came back, barely concious and all tired. I felt so bad. I was helping her with water and all till mum and dad arrived. Eventually they did and mum took my place and me, Samarth and dad left back for home. And that was the day. OR SO WE THOUGHT. 25 minutes after leaving from the hopital, only 15 mins away from home, dad asks- did you take the keys from mum? Well you can imagine how everything else played out. We took a round trip back. That too while being on taxi btw. Oh yes I probably didn't mention this either. It must be out bad time or something these days but my dad was in a car accident recently. Remember I told you bout the dream? 2 days after that. Tells you something doesn't it. I mean it wasn't that bad. He was perfectly fine and safe. The car though... Long story short it's at the service centre. Gonna be gone for a bit. But yeah we went back, took the keys and now we're back home and I'm writing this. I wanna study now but I'm getting a terrible headache so I'll probably go sleep now. On a side note I did miss you a little extra today. I mean it would have been so cool if I had you to talk to while I was there. Could have been fun. I was about to type some another time perhaps but then I remembered I was at a freaking hospital cause someone was admitted... Yea it's probably best to not have a next time in this case.</p>

      <h3><time datetime="2025-09-17">17th September 2025</time></h3>
      <p>I've realised everytime I come back on this web page there's an instant dopamine release. Feel instantly good after seeing all the pictures. Making this might be one of the best ideas I've ever had. Anyway, Nani's back! Woohoooo. She still can't walk for a while but it's ok she'll get better soon everything seems good. You know in the morning when mum came back and dad took her place at the hospital, I don't know what he told mum when he got there but she belived that even though papa left the house at 10:30 am, I went to take the bath after he left. Which is totally not true as I was done with all that way before he left. And so when mum comes back she starts randomly screaming at me for irresponsibility and yata yata. She also saw kitchen slightly not clean cause I had made pizza before. I mean I cleaned it perfectly yesterday cause there was an actual mess after making the pasta. Today it wasn't that much. I kept everything where it should be but left a lil bit. The thing is I clean better when I made the food after being told not to as I'd end up making a mess, which was the case yesterday. Today mum asked me to make something herself and that brought back the carelessness ig. Gotta work on it I suppose. Anyway when dad came back I asked him about what he said, and he's like totally agreeing with me and saying he didn't say anything. Like these guys need to figure their shit out bro. Everyone's terrible with communication. Even last time with me coming back with you, he thought I'll be staying at your place and got mad and also made her mad. Whatever. I was really close to texting you today evening. Like VERY. But I really don't wanna disobey you again. I couldn't even send you the text without starting it off with a sorry for texting you. I realise that if I'm saying sorry for texting you then it means it's something I believe I shouldn't do. And if that's the case then why am I doing it in the first place just to apologize after. So i didn't. But anyhow I don't want my thoughts that were meant to be shared with you to fade away either. So ig pasting that unsent message here would be a good common place.</p>
      <p>Hey
I was working on my essay again and I ended up adding a line about
you just now (don't bother overthinking or asking about it as it wasn't
too crazy or anything and i'll let you know at some point). Just felt like
messaging you after that. I don't expect a reply or anything but yeah I
do miss you a bit though. just a tinzy bit. anyhow back to work</p>

      <h3><time datetime="2025-09-18">18th September 2025</time></h3>
      <p>Another day another entry. I honestly didn't think I'll have to still continue writing here. I was expecting you to have messaged me by now. Honestly I would just hope that at least my writing skills improve from doing this. Because quite frankly I'm having scary thoughts about you. Like bad ones. Have I lost you? Did I finally make a mistake big enough that'll make me the guy who goes down as the next best friend who messed it up? Did I finally get to you? I mean honestly I don't believe you and me are gonna end that easily. This website is proof of that. I have made too many memories with you, have had too many experiences with you for it to be over just like that. Every time I come here I see all the stuff, all the long conversations we've had, all the late nights we pulled, there has been a lot. But you know after 8 days of no contact with you (which is the longest we've gone without talking since over one and a half year and I am afraid it's only gonna get longer), I finally feel the true fear of not having any of that ever again. First I lost the tradition of wishing you morning and night. Then just the next day onwards I couldn't even talk to you during the day. And now well we might be reaching new heights here. I mean you've been on me for acting so weird and impulsive. But here's the thing. I am not as impulsive as I seem to be. I don't just act off of a single instance. I have been feeling a slight growing distance between us ever since the improvement results came out. We have talked via a freaking spotify playlist. That's the shit we were pulling off at some point. And compare that to now. It gets to me Diti. And I can't even discuss it with you properly. I can just never get the timing right. And it just stays there with me. You told me a while ago that you've been feeling that I seem changed and that doesn't feel good to you. But you can not deny that you've changed too. Way more than I have. How do you think that sits with me? Idk maybe end of the day I am childish and I just need you to sit with me and make me realise that. And I suppose that is exactly what's in your head too. And so you're choosing for the perfect time to do that, when you're ready and available to do so. I gotta say if that's the case then I'm not sure if I like your methods. But I can't really disagree with them either. Feels weird typing this now all of a sudden but I love you. I just hope you do too.</p>
