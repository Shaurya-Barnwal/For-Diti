    <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>I started making this when u were sick. We weren’t talking a lot as you were resting and after a really long time
      I went to sleep without wishing you good night. I had only sent a message asking you to take care of yourself,
      unread. Sure, you’d gone “MIA” before — as Aayushmaan and I call it, but I always used to wish you good night
      anyway. However this time around aunty messaged on your behalf informing me that you’re sick. And so I realised
      she could read my texts and think I’m overly needy and desperate. Despite the fact that I am, I don’t want her to
      have that impression of me. Anyhow I was just lying on my bed thinking about the perfect gift for your birthday,
      which I haven’t been able to decide what could be. And so I eventually started thinking about all the memories I
      have with you. I can be so melodramatic sometimes. But anyhow, it hit me — what if I gave you these memories back?
      What if you had a way to go to these memories whenever you wanted to? So I got out of my bed. Told my mum I
      just had a terrific idea and needed to start writing stuff down. And just as I started typing this… guess what
      popped up?
    </p>
    <div>
      <img id="daddy" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='I will daddy.png') }}" alt="I will daddy">
    </div>
    <p>
      There goes my premise...
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="memory" id="Chapter1">
    <h2>The Daddy Incident</h2>
    <p class="1">Ahh yes. What better way to start this than to bring up the iconic “daddy” moment. Truth be told. I
      don’t have the complete details lodged in my mind anymore. You have always been big on nicknames. I personally
      wasn’t a natural nickname user myself. Hadn’t seen people use them so often and so casually. And to see you call
      people honey and sweetheart so often made me quite amazed. Soon as we were talking you called me sweetheart, a
      natural occurrence at this point of our relationship but back then stuff like that used to catch me off guard. And
      so I made a joke saying - “I swear one of these days my mother is gonna see these texts and get the very wrong
      idea”. Made you laugh so hard with that one. God do I love it when you laugh. Makes me feel a weird sense of
      accomplishment when I bring happiness to your face. But yes you doubled down eventually saying "Maybe I’ll use
      double the nicknames to actually get you in trouble." Never thought that would actually become true. In fact,
      we’re way past double. But yes to your doubling down I replied - “Whatever floats your boat…. Sweetheart!” One of
      the most iconic things I’ve ever said to you. Absolutely love it. Made you so flustered with that one. But yes
      that definitely sparked the chain of nicknames between us.
    <p class="1">Eventually I think you got comfortable with nicknames a bit too much. That's the thing that has been
      there between us since forever. You’ve always been ahead of me. At everything. We follow the same path and
      eventually I do catch up to you. But unfortunately or fortunately you always beat me with the check points. You
      called me daddy. Yep. I get that not knowing the “messed up” meaning might make it seem harmless,
      however as a person who knows well and good what that word stands for, it creeped the hell out of me. Idk about
      other people but as a virtuous person (relative term), I couldn’t stand having those kinds of conversations with a
      girl. Not the person I am and nor wanted to be. And I hadn’t really understood that you’re just truly innocent and
      didn’t mean to use the word with any bad intention. And due to that lack of understanding there I did a real pro
      gamer move. I blocked you. (Yeah... sighs while writing.) Made you so worried and panicked. I feel so terrible
      remembering
      that. God what you must have gone through the following night. All worried thinking if our slightly developing
      friendship went down the drain just like that. I mean cut to today where I’m literally ready to kill someone if it
      means I’ll get to talk to you and I don’t even have a topic to talk about. But anyhow as it turns out, our story
      was meant to go a lot ahead. Truly way ahead than I had imagined. So yes we met in school and I talked to
      Aayushmaan and then eventually to you. And after a million apologies I forgave you (don’t think I was mad really
      just being silly). I truly don’t get why I gave you such a hard time starting mein. You know there were so many
      times I had thought I should maintain my distance with this girl. But well. You are too irresistible. And
      honestly? I couldn’t be happier for that.</p>
    </p>

  <section class="memory" id="Chapter2">
    <h2>You Coming Over</h2>
    <p class="2">Till this date I have no idea how it happened but it did. And credit where it's due — special mention
      to Vaibhavi, and a lil bit to Arnima too, I suppose. It truly was undoubtedly the most unexpected thing
      u had ever done for me up to that point. You know recalling that moment also made me realise that I myself haven’t
      really invited you here. Not really. Because if we truly think about it, Arnima was the one who initiated the idea
      as a joke and Vaibhavi was the one who persuaded you behind the scenes. So I’d like to change that and invite you
      over here. That too pretty soon I may add.
    </p>
    <p class="2">It was all honestly done in quite some fashion as well. How you reached here and Krish & me made you
      wait at the gate alone because our hair and skin was too important at the moment (horrible we are), and how I
      could barely spend any time with you despite me being the one who invited you here officially. Trust me, despite
      how much you think I was fixated over Arnima that day, I truly was in awe of the fact that Diti actually is here.
      Couldn’t be with you a lot and when we were free it got too late and we could be together a lot. But yeah, you
      being there meant a lot to me.
    </p>
    <p class="2">Maybe I didn’t truly appreciate the moment back nearly enough back then. But looking back I’m just glad
      for it to have happened. I don’t know exactly how good friends we were at that point but you coming to a place for
      a friend to watch a simple performance, definitely up there on the list of things you’ve done for me I wouldn’t
      think a friend would ever be close enough to me to do. Truly grateful I again am.</p>

    <h2>Happy for you, Not for me </h2>
    <p class="3">So we fought. And we fought pretty bad actually. It happened because we were both being stupid and
      silly. In comparison I was probably worse but I’ve profoundly apologized for it multiple times and you’ve said you
      won’t talk to me anymore if I said sorry for that again. So for that I won’t say sorry here (I really am though).
    </p>
    <p class="3">It all started over something silly and I jokingly said no matter how mad you get, in the end you’ll
      just get desperate and come back to me saying SHAURYAAAAAAA. I mean looking back…. I see no lie here XD. But that
      probably isn’t the best thing a person who’s mad would like to hear. And so you started ignoring me. Leaving me on
      read and not replying. Now that's fair honestly you’re allowed to be mad but well you see; I’m immature. And so
      when you weren’t replying I again did my pro gamer move. Quite the person I am. But well that was only for like a
      very brief moment and I was annoyed at you not replying and wanted to annoy you back a little. But well when I did
      unblock you, you were even more mad and angry. Even I would be. And well it was a long conversation from there.
      And then a real silly thought hit me - is this friendship even worth continuing? I have no idea what came over me
      honestly. But you see I think what was going on in my mind was this is probably the closest friend I’ve ever had.
      You were the only person I had ever gotten so close to. Ever. Be it talking normally, sharing thoughts, feelings
      whatever. I’ve seen you be there for me whenever I’ve needed you and I wouldn’t say I had done the same a lot back
      but I was definitely willing to and was there whenever the opportunity presented itself (not having lunch together
      in school doesn’t count you know that's separate). But anyhow I said - “I think we should talk a little less” Now
      you know it, I know it. I’m basically ending things. I thought this was too much for me mentally. I can’t be
      connected to a person so much on an emotional level and then have so big fights with them for practically no
      reason at all. Didn’t seem good for my mental. And I can’t say this enough — I love you, I love you, and I love
      you sooo much for whatever you did ahead and not actually giving me what I had asked for. I can’t express this
      enough. I’m actually tearing up writing this. That night was sure one hell of a night. But not as bad as the next
      one.
    </p>
    <p class="3">When I said what I said, you simply asked a simple question - is that my solution to the problem? Idk
      why but it did make me reconsider everything. And fortunately I did take everything back. I was still mad at you
      for the rest of the night but by the morning I was fine. However you weren’t completely sure if I’m back to normal
      or not. I’ve told you this now and I'm pretty sure I got this from my father but I cool down as quickly as I heat
      up. Not entirely sure if it's good or bad but that's there. But you wanted to keep talking to me — about anything.
      Anything you could to make sure that I actually don't start “talking less”. Eventually we started talking
      about my performance. I started talking about how we could do things the next time. Maybe you and I could even
      perform together and you would come here again. However you said you might not be able to do that but you’ll be
      here to support me over a video call for sure. Me being confused asked why’s that? And that’s when you revealed
      your big plans of going abroad. Honestly it was quite the shocker. Like that genuinely hit me like a bus. I had
      never imagined and thought of you going away like that. I mean it's not like we would have stayed next door
      forever. We'd still go to college and very likely in different states at some point. But going abroad makes you
      practically inaccessible to me. Sure u can the argument of talking over video calls etc and meeting over the
      holidays, it simply isn’t the same. And that’s probably the first time it actually occurred to me how much you
      mean to me and how much I want you. You had cried a lot the night before and it was my turn now. I genuinely
      weeped like a baby after a pretty long time. And after two hours of crying, I typed the following message.
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='happy.jpg') }}" alt="happy">

    </div>
    <p class="3">Not completely accepting things but letting you know my feelings in my own way which I’m happy you
      understood. And so when you woke up on the third day I had both of us in tears. But that was probably the first
      time deep down I ever felt that I loved you. Didn’t accept it just yet. But deep down, I knew.

    <h2>Farewell</h2>
    <p class="4">
      13th of January 2025. Boy what a day that was. It's definitely on the top 3 days I’ve experienced in my life so
      far. It began with me jokingly telling you the day before how I won’t be spending time with you and will probably
      stick with Krish and the gang. Now I know this is gonna be hard to accept but I say this with truth that I always
      planned and wanted to spend the day with you. In 11th I wasn’t even close with you. Yet on farewell I for some
      reason I felt like spending some time with you. You seemed like a nice person. And Krish as well obviously but he
      spent the time with you for the most
      part of the day and I wasn’t close to you enough to come in between as you guys edited the farewell video. But
      yeah — one regret I had from last year was not spending the farewell with more friends. But I planned to
      change that and hopefully spend some time with at least two people who’ve really made my year worth remembering -
      you and Krish. Well we don’t need to talk about what happened with Krish. But I’m glad my real best friend was
      with me as much as you could be.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      When I reached school, and you can verify this, you were the first person I called. You see, I knew the teachers
      weren’t gonna let us go in the same bus together. They’ll make us go classwise. And so I wanted to spend at least
      some time with you before we left. Unfortunately you were late that day. I just roamed around for 15 mins. Didn’t
      even wanna call Krish. And when I did, dumbass didn’t even pick up and I found him with Raunak. And then of course
      even in the bus he was with Shreya and Aditi and Raunak and I couldn’t even sit with my rest of the friends. You
      know the story, we don't need to make this too sad. You know at some point when I saw you down with Radhika and
      Gaurika, a part of me wanted to be like Ali and be a rebel and go sit with you in your bus. Like I probably
      wouldn’t even care what people would say. But then I saw sir send Ali back to his bus — and yeah, that was pretty
      disappointing. When we reached there we couldn’t be together because they made girls sit on the other side. And
      well there was the award ceremony, your speech and then eventually we did come back school.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      When we reached back we were given around an hour to get our photos clicked. And my Princess is getting pictures
      clicked with all of her friends. And then she soon comes to me and asks for our picture. And I go: JuST yOu aND
      mE? You looked like you’d punch me. But thankfully because of people surrounding us I supposed you didn’t. And
      despite what I said there is nothing more I wanted that day than a picture of you and me. You actually looked so
      pretty that day. And yes, Vrinda clicked our picture — and boy, she ain’t the GOAT for no reason.
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='photo1.jpg') }}" alt="Memory 1">
    </div>
    <p class="4">
      Probably my most favourite picture of us together. Absolutely love everything about it. Our on camera chemistry is
      pretty good I'm not gonna lie. But yes after that I didn’t have lunch with you. Not because I didn’t wanna have it
      with you but because I thought I should spend some time with my other friends as well. That’s the reason I tell
      myself to help myself sleep better while in reality I was just shy of your friends and didn’t wanna be tagging
      along with you too much cause I thought I might end up over doing it.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      And now. The highlight of the evening. The princess danced on stage!!!
    </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='dance.jpg') }}" alt="dance">
    </div>
    <p class="4">
      You told me you were gonna do it, but I didn’t expect you to do it that beautifully. Honestly? That probably made
      me fall in love with you right there — ngl. Truly justified your Ryan Princess award in classic Princess
      fashion. Truly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      We went to Mcdonalds after the farewell ended. Everyone was emotional and sad but I pulled you out in between
      while you were talking to someone because I had already called the taxi. And yeah then we went there and had a
      good time with Vrinda and Samarth. Loved that guy. And then eventually it was time to go home. That’s when
      something weird started to happen. I couldn’t explain if I tried but I was feeling something towards you. Like
      everyone I too wasn’t happy with the thought of school ending. But the thing is it's not the school that any of us
      were gonna miss. It was the people there. Without them, it was just a big building with red walls. Without the
      people it would just feel blue. But the thing is when we leave school we take one or two people from there with
      us, people who we plan to keep a part of our lives. That is probably what helps us go forward. You can’t bring
      everything from your past into your future. But having some meaningful fragments helps you move forward. You see,
      I didn’t have those fragments. I had a Jewel. And that jewel was you. And that jewel was soon about to go away. As
      my father was reaching closer to us,
      to pick us up and eventually drop us home, I could feel my heart sink. I wished this moment of me and you sitting
      together never ended. But the realisation that you’ll soon be going far far away from me, it almost killed a part
      of me. When we were about to get inside the car I told you: I’ll miss you. I seriously can not stress enough how
      many emotions in that moment through those words were being conveyed. I couldn’t cry in front of my father and so
      I pulled it together for a while, before eventually spending an undisclosed amount of time in the bathroom crying
      silently. That day was quite the roller coaster ride for me.
    </p>
    <p class="4">
      Even though now we both plan to go abroad, there’s no 100% guarantee of how close our fates will let us be. But I
      believe in will more than I believe in fate. And that belief is what tells me that you and me princess, we got a
      long road ahead of us.

    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>Well finally I'd just like to wish you all the happiness in the world. I’m not sure if you’re reading this on
      your birthday or a day before. (I might’ve gotten too desperate)
      I cried multiple times while writing this and I'm afriad that I might have made this a bit heavier than I should
      have. But
      I hope I could convey to you how much you mean to me and how much I love you. WISHING YOU THE HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY
      PRINCESS❤️</p>

            <p>I almost burnt down my house today... I turned on the A/C of my room while sitting in the hall🙃 Who
              cares about wasting electricity (I might be a bit spoilt). I mean my aim was to keep the room cold so when
              mum and dad are back they'll find the room already chill and so that would be nice probably. Now as I am
              sitting on the sofa I smell something weird. I thought it's coming from some place else since I was
              sitting near the window. But the smell kept growing. I went to Samarth's room first to check if
              everything's fine. At this point I had my suspicions about the smell coming from a switch board. I smelt
              the switch board of samarth's room but that wasn't the source. And eventually I checked the room whose A/C
              was on. And I could literally see huge sparks coming from the A/C socket board. It was wild. The sunmica
              near the board had started burning. I mean it wasn't sunmica but more of a plastic like substance cause
              actual sunmica would have caught fire. But yeah I ran to the MCB board and asked Samarth to tell me when
              the sparks stop. And one by one I turned off each MCB till they did. Even he was so scared. And then I
              called these guys. And they're not picking up the phone. Like what even is the point of having one if
              you're not gonna pick it up in situations like these. But yeah eventually I called the electrician, he
              checked and said the wire we had used to extend the socket board wasn't that good ig cause that is what
              caught fire. It wasn't as bad thankfully and everything was under control and safe. Definitely a close
              call though.</p>

            <p>I just got to know my Nani's gonna be coming here again. And unfortunately it's not gonna be for happy
              reasons. You remember me telling you that I'm taking them to the doctor a while back? Well it was for her
              knees. She'd randomly fall or slip while walking. I mean she had an injury 6 years ago where she fell into
              a hole or something cause she couldn't see properly. But recently this has been happening. So that didn't
              get better yet and doctors at Ranchi said she'll have to get an operation. They decided if that's the case
              then might as well get it done in Delhi. So yeah we'll be admitting her in Apollo most probably. We have
              good faith there and things have been good everytime we've had to go there for something. So fingers
              crossed everything should be ok again this time. But here's the interesting part: I'll have to stay with
              her in the hospital alone as the attendent. Papa won't be able to stay there the whole time since it's
              hard for him to take too long leaves from office. And mum would stay but with our house going through
              reparing and all right now and Samarth having his exams, it's not possible for her to spend the whole day
              there either. So yeah this is something new I'll be taking on. Hopefully I get to learn a thing or two
              from this.</p>

            <p>I finished the first prototype web page I've been working on these days. That's how I got the idea to
              write
              here too. It's actually pretty interesting too. I'll explain.</p>
            <p>There's a thing called API. I don't know how much you know bout this but it's basically a useable
              database or resource that companies let you use to make your own personal projects. Spotify has one too.
              It basically let's you access the data about all the songs that the spotify's live library has. So you'll
              get access to info like the song's artist, popularity, its tempo, its energy, how groovy it is or
              dancibility in simpler terms. Now not all of the data is useful for the general public but for music
              enthusiasts like you and me, or anyone who's deeply involved with music, these stats can help you in a lot
              of ways. But this data doesn't come up normally on spotify either. You could look things up one by one
              manually on google but that's very tedious and quite frankly boring. You could also use chatGPT. But by
              default chatGPT doesn't have the capability to access spotify's API directly and so it can't give you the
              most useful insights and data. So my idea was what if I integrate chatGPT's API (basically it's
              intelligence in a form that I can reshape and reprograme to work according to my needs) in a way that it
              can access spotify's API directly to give me the the trends and analysis I have been looking for. Now this
              sounds really cool on paper. But actually making this is pretty tough. So for now I made something
              simpler. I call it MAST - Musical Anaysis of Statistics and Trends (Feel free to comment on the name
              btw).I used a csv file (a file that has a limited data about a limited number of songs, around 200k) and
              use python codes to use that data to produce graphs that help me understand it more fluently. Also say if
              I like a song. I can look up the song on my web page and it'll show me all the songs that are similar to
              it in terms of energy, dancibility or tempo. It can also give me comparison of that data of how when u
              increase the energy of the songs, the dancibility increases and etc. I can also look up an artist, say
              taylor swift up on the site. It provides me all of her songs and then presents me a bar graph showing how
              many of her songs are pop, country, rap, dance, or other genres and help me understand her kind of music
              better. It also gives me te average tempo of her songs in each category, gives me how high or low her
              songs are in energy and a few other bits of information. Now say if I were making a song that had an
              energy level of 0.6 or a scale of 0 to 1, i could set the levels to that and I could also set the tempo of
              the song. And then the web page presents me with all songs that follow my set criteria and so I can listen
              to those songs for further ideas and inspiration. Its a lot cooler when you try it yourself like I can't
              wait to show you. Now the version with the limited database works pretty well as of now. Now I'll start
              working on the spotify version and take it to the next step. If everything goes right this could be pretty
              big.</p>

            <p>Ok so we went to the hospital with her and apparently Nani's ACL tissue along with another ligament has
              broken. They can fix it with the operation it's not biggie. Now I came back with her in the morning and
              they said they'll admit her in the evening. Mum and Nani went back there in the evening and they're
              admitted there right now. I'll be going tomorrow morning and take mum's place and stay there for the day.
              Gonna be interesting for sure. I'll also be preparing Samarth's lunch tomorrow. So that should also be
              interesting. Let's see how everything goes. Wish me luck.</p>

          <article class="entry">
            <p>Boy what a day. I got up only after getting 3 hours of sleep today. Made pasta for my breakfast and
              Samarth's lunch. And then left for the hospital so I could switch with mum. I took the taxi but I was
              constantly sleepy. Like throughout. And the only thing keeping me up was all the serial killing shows I've
              watched where the person ends up getting kidnapped in a taxi. I had no intention of becoming a victim. And
              there was so much jam on the road too. Literal hell. Anyhoo I got there and sent mum back home. Was with
              my nani for like 2 hours before she got shifted to the OT. And then it was all me in the bedroom area. And
              I have to say I had more fun than I thought. I tried to sleep but the attendant bed wasn't all that
              comfortable. So I put on Dexter's season 1 that I had downloaded before I left home. It's a goated series
              about serial killing. You should check it out sometime. And then idk if you've ever been to the Apollo in
              Delhi but there's like all sorts of stuff on the ground floor, be it Haldiram or Barista. So I'd like
              watch the show for about an hour, go down because I'd have to pee and the only washroom I knew of was on
              the ground floor and I was too shy to ask where's the other. Then I'd eat legit whatever I want. So much
              variety too. So yeah I experimented a lot. Eat, drink, watch, pee and repeat. That's gotta be peak life. I
              tried Americano for the first time ever. That too iced. I legit thought of your coffee making mishap that
              you told me about. And let me tell you if you already didn't know this, though I'm sure you do, if you
              ever have to choose between drinking an americano or your own piss (like Bear freaking Grills or
              something), choose the later. Probably will taste better. Eventually after 4 hours I got a call from the
              doctor. The surgery was a success and they'll be keeping her for observation for a while. After a dozen
              calls to all the family members I was back to my routine soon. Eventually she came back, barely conscious
              and all tired. I felt so bad. I was helping her with water and all till mum and dad arrived. Eventually
              they did and mum took my place and me, Samarth and dad left back for home. And that was the day. OR SO WE
              THOUGHT. 25 minutes after leaving from the hospital, only 15 mins away from home, dad asks- did you take
              the keys from mum? Well you can imagine how everything else played out. We took a round trip back. That
              too while being in a taxi btw. Oh yes I probably didn't mention this either. It must be a bad time or
              something these days but my dad was in a car accident recently. Remember I told you about the dream? 2
              days after that. Tells you something doesn't it. I mean it wasn't that bad. He was perfectly fine and
              safe. The car though... Long story short it's at the service centre. Gonna be gone for a bit. But yeah we
              went back, took the keys and now we're back home and I'm writing this. I wanna study now but I'm getting a
              terrible headache so I'll probably go to sleep now. On a side note I did miss you a little extra today. I
              mean it would have been so cool if I had you to talk to while I was there. Could have been fun. I was
              about to type some another time perhaps but then I remembered I was at a freaking hospital cause someone
              was admitted... Yea it's probably best to not have a next time in this case.</p>

            <p>I've realised everytime I come back on this web page there's an instant dopamine release. Feel instantly
              good after seeing all the pictures. Making this might be one of the best ideas I've ever had. Anyway,
              Nani's back! Woohoooo. She still can't walk for a while but it's ok she'll get better soon everything
              seems good. You know in the morning when mum came back and dad took her place at the hospital, I don't
              know what he told mum when he got there but she belived that even though papa left the house at 10:30 am,
              I went to take the bath after he left. Which is totally not true as I was done with all that way before he
              left. And so when mum comes back she starts randomly screaming at me for irresponsibility and yata yata.
              She also saw kitchen slightly not clean cause I had made pizza before. I mean I cleaned it perfectly
              yesterday cause there was an actual mess after making the pasta. Today it wasn't that much. I kept
              everything where it should be but left a lil bit. The thing is I clean better when I made the food after
              being told not to as I'd end up making a mess, which was the case yesterday. Today mum asked me to make
              something herself and that brought back the carelessness ig. Gotta work on it I suppose. Anyway when dad
              came back I asked him about what he said, and he's like totally agreeing with me and saying he didn't say
              anything. Like these guys need to figure their shit out bro. Everyone's terrible with communication. Even
              last time with me coming back with you, he thought I'll be staying at your place and got mad and also made
              her mad. Whatever. I was really close to texting you today evening. Like VERY. But I really don't wanna
              disobey you again. I couldn't even send you the text without starting it off with a sorry for texting you.
              I realise that if I'm saying sorry for texting you then it means it's something I believe I shouldn't do.
              And if that's the case then why am I doing it in the first place just to apologize after. So i didn't. But
              anyhow I don't want my thoughts that were meant to be shared with you to fade away either. So ig pasting
              that unsent message here would be a good common place.</p>
            <p>Hey <br>
              I was working on my essay again and I ended up adding a line about
              you just now (don't bother overthinking or asking about it as it wasn't
              too crazy or anything and i'll let you know at some point). Just felt like
              messaging you after that. I don't expect a reply or anything but yeah I
              do miss you a bit though. just a tinzy bit. anyhow back to work
            </p>

            <p>Another day another entry. I honestly didn't think I'll have to still continue writing here. I was
              expecting you to have messaged me by now. Honestly I would just hope that at least my writing skills
              improve from doing this. I don't have much to say today so I'll keep this one short. Hopefully I hear back
              from you soon. This is the longest we've not talked since knowing each other and it's really killing me.
              See you soon.</p>

            <p>Thank god you texted me today. It really gave me a sense of peace that I've been missing. Have
              been worrying too much and overthinking and all you know how it is. But it's absolute comedy how you
              choose to message me today. I mean you know few days before I prayed to god regarding you. I wished to be
              able to perform with you. And a few days later BANG I can't even talk to you. So today I got mad at him.
              Like I just started getting a little faith in him and this is how I'm rewarded. Guess he heard me lol.
              This has happened to me before too. Like there have been two other times when I prayed real hard to god
              with full conviction and belief and he does the exact opposite. But then I get angry and then I figure out
              it was a part of his grand scheme. God's freaking plan baby. So yeah I'm assuming this is a part of that
              too. Also you said I could text you if it's something urgent or big like nani going to the hospital. I
              mean it's not urgent really so I didn't take the risk. I mean sure I wanted to talk to you during that
              time but it's not like you can make it better or anything just by hearing about it. Also I didn't wanna
              worry you for no reason either cause like sure I'd get your attention and all with bringing up hospital
              and stuff but like it felt like emotional guilt tripping in a sense? Idk. But yeah it's nothing too crazy
              everything's all good I'm just waiting for things to be better with you so I can talk to you in peace. And
              I wanna hear you a bit too. Would be nice. Also it's insane that I put you on archive just today and you
              message me right after. Absolutely crazy. God working mysterious ways for real. Even though I said it
              there but i'll say it again that I wasn't ignoring you on purpose or anything. You can clearly see my
              desperation from all this. I'll never ignore you. Just unfortunate timing. But yeah I hope everything's
              fine with you and we get to meet soon.</p>
            <p>Good nini (not gonna call you princess cause told me not to as you're still mad at me🥺)❤️</p>

            <p>I talked to my Mami today. The one who's daughter got caught with the guy and stuff. Boy what a therapy
              session. It started with my mum talking but since she just got a tooth job she couldn't talk much and she
              knew I'd handle stuff well so she passed me the phone. I talked for TWO FREAKING HOURS. Holy mother of all
              that is pure. That was insane. She was so good with turning topics around. Legit confused me and made me
              forget my own points thrice. But yeah I talked to her and to my cousin too. They all had their parts and
              stories. See my sister I can pass for being in her teenage rebelious phase. But what Mami's doing. She's
              actually a terrible parent. It's so much. God I wanna yap about it so bad to you. Please come back I
              really miss you. But yeah as I was giving her my piece of mind, my other Mami and Mamaji came too. With
              their daughters. The ones you met on my birthday. They came to see Nani ma. But yeah then they're all
              listening to my sermon. And like they were impressed honestly. I mean what can I say I am a lot more
              mature and smart than people give me credit for🤭. It was so long of a conversation I don't even wanna
              spoil everything here. But I'm pretty sure I'll forget it all by the time we talk. It's sad. I hope not. I
              just hope to see you soon.</p>

            <p>You get annoyed these days too easily I swear to god. Sure I get it from you perspective. You've already
              told me you're going through a lot right now. And asking about something that prioritizes my own interests
              despite knowing that is stupid. But I still have no idea what this "lot" is. And it's hard for me to
              understand what's possible here and what's not. And I'm not pressuring you to tell me about it right away
              either. But idk like I'll explain my perspective why I asked the question again.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I had told about everyone, be it mum or friends, that I wanted perform with you. And yes you'll say
              that I told you about it too late or I didn't discuss with you much about it and planned it myself in my
              head. But we weren't even talking much before the day I did bring it up. And before that I had been
              talking about it here and there but I suppose you didn't take me as seriously cause I'll try bring it up
              and you'll jokingly say oh yes "I'm performing with Sashwat and Avi too". But whatever. When I realised
              that it wasn't happening, I did tell these guys too you won't be coming. Soon after that, Neeyati
              introduced me to a new friend of her's and tells me she'd like to perform and sing. Initially Geetanjali,
              the girl, wanted me to just play the guitar with her. But I shrugged it off as I didn't wanna do it. But
              then Neeyati suggested that I could just add her to the band. I have no interest in that either. But it's
              hard to explain to these guys why. I'm not gonna explain why but I hope you know what was going on in my
              head to not just take her instead of you like that. But I had been debating whether I should or not. It
              just wasn't feeling right. So I thought I'll ask you one last time. Maybe something happens. But before I
              could explain much you got all mad at me. And I hate how you have been reacting with me these days. You
              get mad at every little thing. I genuinely didn't like you qouting me on that selfish thing. Really never
              expected you to do that. Maybe I was a little selfish which I couldn't see because of my own stupidity. I
              still didn't deserve that sarcasm there. I get that we're close to the point that you can call me out when
              I make mistakes and I wouldn't mind it. But it still doesn't mean that I can't be hurt. You're telling me
              you'd call out Vrinda like that to her face when she was pursuing you with her thing? Call her selfish? Or
              qoute her in a sarcastic way you did with me? No you wouldn't. So I really don't get this different
              showcase of love towards me. And mind you again that me and her are not the same case. You explicitly told
              her no because of your upcoming exams and your grandpa's condition and she still kept on pushing you about
              it. I have tried my best to be respectful towards you. All I wanted was a yes or no. I wouldn't hold it
              against you for saying no. Sure I'd be disappointed but at least I won't be praying looking up in the sky,
              waiting for miracles to happen.</p>
            <p>Ok on a side note... How's your grandfather btw? I am so sorry it came up on my mind so many times and I
              wanted to ask you if he got any better but it'll just always end up slipping off my mind eventually. I
              feel terrible I'm really sorry. I hope he did get better.</p>

            <p>Really feel like talking to you. I can't have peace when we end things like that. And don't take this the
              wrong way but boy is it hypocritical of you to leave me on read like that after telling me to not go
              offline on you when I didn't reply for 2 mins. But you asked me to be patient and calm. So I'll be. I mean
              I'll try cause I just know I'm gonna do something stupid here and there time to time. For that I am sorry
              in advance. Just bear with me. Also I'm feeling this and I wanna say it but I know I shouldn't. So I feel
              typing this should make it better for now. Plus you'll only be reading it like after a while so I don't
              think you'll get mad or anything then. Hopefully not. But yeah it's really tragic how you could make it
              here last year when we weren't even that close and now you can't. Unfortunate circumstances ig. But yeah I
              do feel bad. I mean ofcourse I will feel bad. I had been looking forward to this since what feels like
              forever. I did talk to mum about it and she did explain that it's ok and Diti must have had a reason.
              Obviously I know that. But yeah I feel what I feel. Hopefully I'll be over it at some point. We're gonna
              have quite the performance this year. We have Yuvi bhaiya as our drummer this time. You probably remember
              him. He's
              also the bhaiya we called in for our farewell performance in 11th. He's super good. And we have a bassist
              this time too. We have practice tomorrow at a jampad 9am. Will be fun. I wish I could show you the songs
              that I'll be singing atleast or take your opinions. Hopefully later.</p>
            <p>I'm having trouble sleeping today for some reason so I came back here. Things I'm doing these days god.
              I'm literally 2 steps away from going schizo. You know when I told mum that how you won't be coming, I
              also said how you're busy and how I talked to you yesterday after a week. Hearing that she goes: "So
              that's why you've been so out of it these days. Papa bhi keh rahe the kahan khoya rehta hai ye👁️👁️."
              Bruh. Whatever. But yeah she did comfort me so yeah I felt good after. She said it's ok you'll get chances
              abhi just enjoy what you're doing with
              the current people. So yeah I'll do that.</p>
            <p>In other news I had a dream of you like 3 days ago. You had a little sister who almost drowned but I
              saved her😌. It was full on movie type shit lol. I even met aunty after that. But I am pretty sure at some
              point in my dream I was naked☠️. And I genuinely don't remember any context what so ever😭. I'm pretty
              sure it wasn't me doing any weird stuff but still like idk maybe I dropped my towel or something. Terrible
              terrible sight.</p>

            <p>I got an ingrown toenail this week. I have been in constant pain. It's the third time I have ever had it.
              And just like before it was bad again, infected with pus and all. I took antibiotic so it heals but I knew
              from past times that just the medicine isn't gonna cut it. But I didn't wanna go through the whole ass
              surgery again. And my parents freak out a lot with this stuff too. So I decided to do the micro surgery
              myself. I had seen how it's done before and I have a good feel for it. So yeah did it and surprisingly
              blood and pus don't gross me out anymore. And the whole thing ended up being a lot cleaner than you'd
              expect. I'd attach an image but it's just gross. I sprayed it with sanitizer after. Apparently I shouldn't
              have done that cause it slows down the healing process a bit and it stings too. Well pain's an old friend.
              But yes the constant sting is gone now and I actually feel so much better. If my parents found out I'll be
              scolded bad for doing it myself, as one wrong cut and it gets dangerous. That's what happened last time.
              Like the thing is last time I had to get my entrie nail removed. That's how bad the infection was. This
              time it wasn't as bad and so I trusted myself to do it. I mean I specifically bought special nail cutters
              for the corner of nails so I don't get the ingrown toenail again. I often cut it whenever I feel it's
              starting to grow but a while back as I was doing the same, I ended up making a wrong cut which eventually
              led me to today. It's a risky game that I am playing. I guess I could just go to the pedicure guys at the
              salon. I'll consider it next time. Honestly that just feels like a waste of time and money. Idk. But yeah
              I definitely don't feel the pain anymore.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since I've said it but you're actually so cute. I mean when you were apologizing so
              profoundly today, call me sadistic or something but I found that pretty cute. Like you're stupid silly
              cute idk. I mean even though I wasn't expecting it I do appreciate the apology cause you probably saw from
              the entry above that I was a little mad at you about it before but it's ok I realised even I was at fault
              there and I did forgive you already. In other news I went to sector 18 today with Pragyanshu. We left at
              7pm and took the auto there. We were looking to rent a drum kit and his idea was we should go and check it
              out for ourselves in person and so we did. It was cool. Honestly I just like grabbing any chance I get to
              go out into the real world and act all grown up. My god I saw so many guitars there it was literal heaven.
              The kit we got is like crazy good apparently. I mean I don't know much about it but Pragyanshu did and he
              talked it out with Yuvraj bhaiya too. The actual cost of the kit is worth 1.5L! Holy. I mean we're only
              renting it but still damn. It better sound godly for what I've heard about it. But yeah we sadly couldn't
              find any auto on our way back so we had to take the metro which is always fun. And yeah we came back home
              around 9. Simple and easy.</p>

    <p>Yeah yeah I said the entry above would be my last. But you know I think I punished you enough. Well you may
      wonder how did I do that? Well do you remember me telling you that I wrote a letter for you once? That too
      handwritten? Well I actually wrote two. And then do you remember asking me about an image on my whatsapp status of
      few random pages with writings on them horribly torn? You may connect the dots... I was like really angry that day
      what can I say hehe. So yeah those heartfelt letters that I wrote you? You're never getting to see em. Gone with
      the wind.</p>
    <p>I honestly can't not have something like this. It's impossible for me to have a thought in my brain that I felt
      like sharing with you, and then just supress it and move on with my day. If I am missing you then I wanna scream
      to the world that I AM MISSING DITI. But apni mata shree ko dhyaan mein rakhte hue main dusri cheezon se hi kaam
      chala lunga🙏🥷</p>

            <p>Well it's been a while since I did this. Its honestly so funny that I had a whole episode of thoughts and
              emotion and you don't even remotely have an idea this is happening. Well a few days ago I had a dream
              about you again. It was pretty much exactly the scenerio we're currently in. Like you asked me to not text
              you. But by the time you did contact me, you apparantly had already gone through some crazy stuff. I was
              initially mad at you as you kept me waiting but then you were telling me about it while crying. Then we're
              both crying. I don't think it was something that happened at home though. I'm not even sure entirely. I
              just hope it's all good irl. It probably is.</p>
            <p>
              On a different note... I wanted to say this to you but right before I could you put that no message curfew
              bs on me. But yeah whenever you're like talking in the teasing sarcastic tone messaging stuff like "main
              janti hoon" and whatever, besides being cute it's like oddly attractive ngl. Idk what's up with that.
              Maybe it's cause we mostly converse in english and so the sudden change of tone tickles my brain in a good
              way. Probably that.
            </p>
            <p>Also why did you not comment on my picture that I put on status? The one where I'm wearing the black
              shirt with marooon pants. I was lowkey cosplaying conrad from the wedding. I even messaged you with
              conrad's picture giving you the perfect setup to compliment me but nothing🥺😔. It's such a shame. You
              know that picture was the most likes I've ever gotten on insta? Literally everyone complimented me
              themselves when they saw me ncihe. These guys don't compliment me that often. So yeah it was pretty big.
              You know I was clicking Neeyati's and Vaibhavi's friends pictures with all of them together and then 2
              people at a time and I'm going full photographer mode asking them to turn and face the camera with the
              right angle and stuff. Oh yeah Trisha was one of em🤭. She said I swear itni ache se meri photos kisi
              ladki ne bhi nahi kiche aaj taj😭. Lmao. And so yeah even those guys were super nice to me after. But yeah
              I think this is pretty much all I'm gonna say today.</p>
            <p>Now the million dollar question is do I end this with good nini or no? Honestly my soul's being shattered
              a little everyday since I haven't said good nini to you in any form. And well it's been a millennia since
              I did it irl because you said we shouldn't anymore. Ok I don't wanna think about all that I'll end up
              crying. Meh I'll just do it.</p>
            <p>Good nini❤️</p>

            <p>You haven't been texting me cause not only you couldn't get a hold of your phone recently as it's been
              mostly with your mum or brother, you also have been busy. And you know what I have been okay with that. I
              mean yeah you take your work more seriously than me and so unlike me you are probably stressing about
              college apps way more. Totally cool with that. Now over the course of last week I'd see you see my status
              on whatsapp or stories on instagram. I made the mistake of assuming its you before and yeah so I assumed
              it's your mum or moksh whatever. Or maybe you saw whatsapp on your PC and you can't like it from there and
              couldn't text about it either just yet. Also totally fine. But now I am seeing your like on Taylor swift's
              post. A post made only 17 hours ago. So not only you recently got a hold of your phone, you were also free
              enough to scroll instagram. And so you choose to do that instead of messaging me. I really wanna know what
              your reasoning was this time. 'Oh I just opened insta for "something" as I had to do "something" and so I
              just double tapped it without paying much attention to it.' Like you wouldn't like my posts before cause
              you were worried that your other friends might get mad that you're liking my posts but not replying to
              them. And then you'll do the same thing when it comes to me. So not only you're afraid to piss off your
              other more friends than me, you also prioritize liking the MOTHER's post and scrolling instagram more than
              talking to me. We used to be at a point where we'd talk everyday. At least greet each other once in some
              way. But well now here we are. And I just know at the end of this I'm gonna be the one who'll be wrong and
              end up feeling bad. Hell chances are by the time you read this I'd have already forgiven you. You said if
              I am mad at you or I have a problem with you then it's you I should take up with right? Well look at this
              beauty right here:</p>
            <p>"don't text till i text</p>
            <p>don't reply"</p>
            <p>But you know what unlike before I am not making any more mistakes on my conscience. I will NOT text you
              still. I will do exactly as you said. I won't go down and talk to Gaurika or Vaibhavi about this. I'll cry
              alone for now cause that's all I can do.</p>
            <p>Ok this is me a few hours later after I punched a marble wall too hard. Twice... Not my brightest move honestly. I still
              feel like crying but now I have more than one reason. It's actually a little red I hope it doesn't go
              sore.</p>
            <p>I honestly don't even know what even is the point of me doing all this. It feels like you have demoted me
              as a friend. From being your favorite person now I'm just another one you know. And that is what hurts me
              the most these days. To me you're still my favorite girl. And my favorite person and best friend. But I
              don't know if that's the same with you anymore. I just hope all of this is in my head and you know what it
              probably is. But it's just that there's only so many times I can keep telling myself that before I loose
              the conviction in it. I just wish I could hear it from you once.</p>
